# WP4T42-07 Hierarchical Metascheduler

The hierarchical metascheduler is an offline tool that invokes a scheduler (Genetic Algorithm) repeatedly to compute adapted schedules for each runtime context event. The inputs to the metascheduler consist of the application model describing the computational jobs and communication messages for a given application, the platform model describing the system architecture on which the application is executed, and the context model describing all runtime context events pertinent to the application and platform. 

Runtime context events within a system, either at the FRACTAL node level or in a set of FRACTAL nodes, are adapted to for energy efficiency and fault recovery by optimizing the system resource allocation (scheduling). The computed schedules allow for runtime adaptation of the system to context events.

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide the user on setting up the hierarchical metascheduler on a local machine and computing a multi-schedule graph (MSG) for any application (AM), platform (PM) and context model (CM).

For instructions on generating the AM, PM or CM, see WP4T42-03.
